					We have some technical problems with facebook for validation of Mutopedia API. The validation would take about five days according facebook, so we have to wait for their approval before opening Mutopedia.<br/>
					We hope you will understand and will do all that is possible to present you the site in the shortest possible time.<br/>
					Thank you !
